# Features
> - This is the project of a calculator with the follow basics oprations: +, -, *, /, **, +/-, parenthisis and memory.
> - This project is built in html-css-js linked to a wasm built in rust language.
> - In the top display is showed an infix expression that is formad by insertion of numbers, operators, memory and parenthisis.
> - The expression above is solved by a rust code accomplished to javascript class by a web assembly. (WASM)
> - WebAssembly (or WASM) is a binary language that is converted efficiently into machine code by the browser, which runs it much more efficiently than JavaScript.
> - The respective infix expression can also be solved by the javascript eval() function, for that you just have to uncomment the respective code and comment the line that contains the solve_infix() function. (the eval() function cannot correctly resolve negative numbers preceded by operators, the solve_infix() function, a rust function, can do this perfectly.

> ## After placing the result in memory with the MS button
> Note that the value is shown below the MR button.

> ## Using the memory value.
> And, obviously, you can capture the MR value at any time.
